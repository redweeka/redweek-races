# redweek races

- 99 riders
- 5 riders every race
- race every day
- 3 diffrent length tracks (100, 200, 300)
- races play like this: 
    - random rider start the first round of steps (get between 1 - 10 (multiply by track length / 100))
    - every next round until the end of the race, by order from the fartherest one till the closest one, will get thair steps (the idea is to see who won first, and its reasonable that the fartherest one will cross the finish line first)
- for every rider the starting price is the bet X2
- for every rider race
    - change his price
        - if won decrese his price by 0.1 (the minimum price for bet is 1.1)
            - raise his chances to win (by raising his random steps chances)
        - if lose raise his price by 0.1
